## A DIGITAL COMMONS FOR THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES

> In the coming years, how might digital tools and platforms—such as the in-development Canadian Humanities and Social Sciences Commons (hsscommons.ca)—address the rapidly changing needs of HSS scholars and scholarly societies? Join Leslie Weir (Library and Archives Canada), Julia M. Wright (Dalhousie University), and Gabriel Miller (Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences) for a discussion of how digital research infrastructure can facilitate new forms of open, collaborative, and ethical knowledge mobilization in Canada and beyond.

### Knowledge-sharing in the (mis)information Age: supporting researcher safety and information hygiene

Julia M Wright

Protecting expert advice for the public: promoting safety and improved communications

- misinformation
- disinformation
- infodemic
- information hygiene

«Believe in Science»



Gabriel Miller



misrepresentation / underrepresentation → financial pressure: building a wall to control who gets in

situated knowledge vs removal of author name in publications. erasing identities vs visibility of identity that clearly opens or closes doors





## Idées Ouvroir

- atelier de création de compte & entrée de contenu 

HSS commons : diffusion publique (Qui prend la charge de la diffusion?)

- how to further the integration of research processes all the way to sharing (workflows, how to make users be users)

> Hi, Lena! Do feel free to get in touch with us after the event--we'd be happy to talk more about workflows and how other groups have met those challenges (ghjensen@uvic.ca or winterc@uvic.ca).
